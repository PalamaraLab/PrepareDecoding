# ASMC Prepare Decoding

Tool to compute decoding quantities.

## Quickstart

### Install the Python module from PyPI

Most functionality is available through a Python module which can be installed with:

```bash
pip install asmc-preparedecoding
```

This Python module is currently available on Linux and macOS.
We hope it will be available soon on Windows.

Examples for using the Python module can be found in the following Jupyter notebook:
- [creating decoding quantities](notebooks/CreatingDecodingQuantities.ipynb)

Please note that you must install Jupyter in order to view the notebook, and then open it:

```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter-notebook notebooks/CreatingDecodingQuantities.ipynb
```
